# Two-Button Keyboard BCI Project Progress

## Latest Updates (December 11, 2024)

### Completed Features
- Enhanced phrase matcher with candidate generation
- Comprehensive test suite implementation
- Phi-2 LLM integration with Metal acceleration
- Pattern-based word prediction
- Multi-word phrase prediction
- Caching system for frequent predictions

### Current State
- Basic keyboard interface functional
- LLM integration working with greedy decoding
- Test suite passing 7/8 cases
- Pattern matching latency: ~50ms
- Phrase prediction latency: ~2s
- Frontend supports phrase building

### Technical Implementation
- Phi-2 model running on MPS with Metal acceleration
- Pattern matcher using frequency-based scoring
- React frontend with pattern batching
- Flask backend with async LLM initialization
- Caching layer for common predictions

### Known Issues
1. Question response prediction needs improvement ("I am doing fine" test failing)
2. Latency still high for multi-word phrases (~2s)
3. Frontend could better handle rapid input
4. Need better context utilization in LLM prompts

### Next Steps
1. Improve response prediction accuracy:
   - Enhanced context handling in prompts
   - Better candidate scoring for responses
   - Special handling for common phrases

2. Optimize performance:
   - Reduce LLM latency through prompt optimization
   - Improve caching strategy
   - Better input batching

3. Enhance user experience:
   - Smoother phrase building
   - Better visual feedback
   - More responsive predictions

4. Implement learning system:
   - Personal vocabulary tracking
   - Usage pattern learning
   - Context-aware adaptation

## Technical Details

### Model Configuration
- Using Phi-2 (2.7B parameters)
- Running in float16 precision
- Metal acceleration enabled
- Greedy decoding for consistency

### Performance Metrics
- Single word prediction: ~50ms
- Phrase prediction (2-3 words): ~1s
- Phrase prediction (4+ words): ~2s
- Cache hit rate: TBD
- Prediction accuracy: ~80% for common phrases
